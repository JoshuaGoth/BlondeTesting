 Testing by creating /post/four/index.md instead of /post/four.md. Trying to see which uniformity flows. ![Cramp Logo](/img/cramp.png "super cool")
 Logo
 ![Logo](/img/oops.png)
 
 Logo works with /img/. Need to get logo working from within content folder ![Image](/post/four/cramp.png)
 The above image works when I set image location to /post/four/cramp.png
 
 Image from directly within the container folder: ![Image](cramp.png) - Works on Hugo Server. Lets see which works when publishing online.
