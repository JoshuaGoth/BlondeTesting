As a network veteran, I&amp;rsquo;m here to share some super valuable tips on how to minimize downtime in the workplace. After all, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a productive workday without those pesky IT issues getting in the way?

According to a report by IT Brand Pulse (1), 80% of businesses experience at least one hour of downtime per week, resulting in an average loss of $5,000 per minute!
