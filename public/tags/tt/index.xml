      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I take any digs at artificial intelligence (as Hollywood portrays it and as we fear it), allow me to express that I am all for using technology to benefit us. Artificial intelligence, as it currently exists, is useful. As a technical tool, it&amp;rsquo;s downright phenomenal. I should be a fan of technology; after all, I spent the better half of my life as a network engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not. Not because it makes my life difficult or tied to any otherworldly belief system, but because I can see where this is heading, and it&amp;rsquo;s not good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
